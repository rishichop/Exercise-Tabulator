Automatically add your daily exercise achievements in Tabular format(Google Sheet).

You just tell the program what and how much you exercised that day in natural language. Using language processing from Nutritionix api it will get the approx duration and calories burned based on your weight, height and age.
Using the Sheety api which is connected to your google sheet of your choice, it will add the necessary information into the google sheet.

You can host the program in online ides like Replit to add your exercise data remotely.

*You will need to change the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, weight, height and age according to your choice.
